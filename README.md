## This repo contains the project files for a terminal-run ATM interface I made for a school assignment.

It might still have some bugs I'm never going to fix, muhaha.

Thanks for checking it out tho :)

<hr>

## How to run the program

1. Download the latest release
2. Unzip the file into a folder of your liking
3. Run `Pankkiautomaatti.exe`

<br>

Or just compile it yourself nerd ass<br>
<sub>Cos the C source file might have a newer version than the release, oop</sub>
