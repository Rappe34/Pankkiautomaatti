## This repo contains the project files for a terminal-run ATM interface I made for a school assignment.

It might still have some bugs I'm never going to fix, muhaha.

Thanks for checking it out tho 👍

## How to run the program

1. Download the latest release
2. Unzip the file into a folder of your liking
3. Run `Pankkiautomaatti.exe`
